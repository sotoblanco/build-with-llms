    "**TL;DR:**  \n",
    "This notebook provides a framework for evaluating factual consistency in summarization models and scaling this process with LLMs. You'll learn how to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and preprocess a dataset containing source texts, correct summaries, and distractor (incorrect) summaries.  \n",
    "- Annotate summaries for factual consistency using binary labels (pass/fail) and calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.  \n",
    "- Identify common failure modes in incorrect summaries to better understand model behavior.  \n",
    "- Train an LLM as a judge to evaluate summaries based on human annotations, providing scalability for larger datasets.  \n",
    "- Monitor LLM judgments over time by validating against human-labeled samples to ensure alignment and consistency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This end-to-end approach combines human and LLM-based evaluations to iteratively improve summary generation workflows and build reliable evaluation systems.  "

    "# Homework Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the app we’re building generates emails based on data extracted from LinkedIn profiles in structured output format. For this homework, you’ll take the concepts we’ve covered in this class and apply them to this specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Think About Dimensions of Interest**  \n",
    "   - When extracting structured data from LinkedIn profiles, what specific fields (dimensions) are you most interested in?  \n",
    "     Examples might include:\n",
    "     - Name\n",
    "     - Current Job\n",
    "     - Top Skills\n",
    "     - Education\n",
    "   - Consider which fields are most critical for generating accurate and meaningful emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Design an Annotation Process**  \n",
    "   - If you were to evaluate the LLM’s outputs, how would you set up your annotations?  \n",
    "     - Would you simply annotate using **Pass/Fail**, or would you evaluate specific fields independently (e.g., \"Name\" is correct, \"Current Job\" is incorrect)?  \n",
    "     - What criteria would you use to evaluate each field?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Spreadsheet for Annotation**  \n",
    "   - Set up a spreadsheet that includes:\n",
    "     - The input (e.g., LinkedIn profile text).\n",
    "     - The LLM’s generated structured output.\n",
    "     - Columns for your annotations, reflecting the dimensions you care about (e.g., \"Name Pass/Fail,\" \"Current Job Pass/Fail,\" \"Top Skills Pass/Fail\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterate on the Process**  \n",
    "   - Test your prompt on a sample set of LinkedIn profiles.\n",
    "   - Identify failure patterns. For example:\n",
    "     - The prompt might be effective at extracting \"Name\" and \"Current Job\" but less effective at \"Top Skills.\"\n",
    "   - Adjust your process to improve the weak areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reflect on Your Approach**  \n",
    "   - How does your annotation setup influence how you evaluate the LLM’s performance?  \n",
    "   - Would a different approach (e.g., more granular or less granular evaluation) lead to better insights?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply this entire process to the LinkedIn profile extraction task, and think critically about how to optimize both the prompts and the evaluation setup for your app."
